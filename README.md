# Airlift

Airlift is a self-hosted file upload and sharing service. It includes a server
(`airlift-server(1)`) and a CLI client (`lift(1)`). GUI clients for OS X, iOS,
Windows, and Linux and binary downloads for server coming soonâ„¢.

The client uploads files to the server and returns a nice link for you to
share. Just bring your own server and domain.

You should use deuiore/load.link instead of this if...

- ...you like PHP;
- ...you don't like me;
- ...you're on a free/cheap shared host that doesn't allow long-running
  processes.
