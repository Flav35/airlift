# Airlift

Airlift is a self-hosted file upload and sharing service. It includes a server
(`airlift-server(1)`) and a CLI client (`lift(1)`). A preliminary OS X GUI
client may be found at [moshee/AirliftOSX](https://github.com/moshee/AirliftOSX).
GUI clients for iOS, Windows, and Linux coming soonâ„¢.

The clients upload files to the server and return a nice link for you to
share. Just bring your own server and domain.

You should use [deuiore/load.link](https://github.com/deuiore/load.link)
instead of this if...

- ...you like PHP;
- ...you don't like me;
- ...you're on a free/cheap shared host that doesn't allow long-running
  processes.
